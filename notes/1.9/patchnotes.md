# Patch notes
## New Features
**New control scheme: Quickfire**
  - ~~Stolen~~ Used with permission from TheyCallMeXander's SA-X Duels. Beams, missiles, and supers all have their own button. Power bombs are deployed with the missile button.
   
**Players can see the item inside the Core-X**
  - No longer do people need to memorize a table of colors or what color Zazabi was, now the items can optionally be seen on the Core-X itself. Enabled through the Sensitivity Mode setting.
  - TODO: make it its own setting
   
## Balance changes
**Core-X absorbs no longer freeze you in place**
  - This had the ability to kill your speed boosts and softlock you on elevators, so it was removed.
   
**All health drops are 20 HP**
  - Farming for health was a laborious process and slowed down the game more than anything else.
   
**Thoth elevator no longer spawns unless you ride it up**
  - The elevator is very restrictive to your movement and can cause softlocks when the game gets paused. SA-X were already routinely riding it down then jumping back up the elevator shaft, so it seemed best to remove it entirely.
   
**EMP doors open as soon as the battery is in place**
  - TODO: write non-dismissive description text
  - TODO: make the door sound play at the right time
   
**SA-X map starts out gray**
  - The SA-X map always being filled made it hard to tell where you and your teammates had been, and especially affected non-experimental games.
  - TODO: make metroids properly display on the SA-X map
   
## Map changes
**Main Caves**
  - Added a one-way pipe above the Entrance to Area 3, you can open it with a missile!

  - Added a screw-locked shortcut from the U-bend room near First Alpha to the A2 EMP Ball room.
    - (possible example image pending)
  - Added a screw-locked shortcut between the cave with the shinespark item and the top right Gamma metroid.
   
**Industrial Complex**
  - Added a speed-locked shortcut from deep A3 "the one I never want to hear about again" to the BG3 room before the final Gamma metroid.
  - Added a screw-locked pipe between deep A3 "the one I never want to hear about again" and the A1 EMP Ball room.
   
## Bug fixes
  - Changed the config location to prevent issues with new settings.
  - Add some default values to prevent crashes.
  - Made some screw attack blocks stop appearing when you don't have screw attack to prevent getting trapped.
  - Allow players to pick up items if they stopped being a spectator/Core-X without resetting the room.
  - Fix the one missing screw block in the Bullet Hell room.
  - Scrub newline characters from usernames when they get set.
