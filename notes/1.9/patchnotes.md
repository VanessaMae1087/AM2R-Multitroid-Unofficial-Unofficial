# Patch notes
## New Features
**New control scheme: Quickfire**
 - ~~Stolen~~ Used with permission from TheyCallMeXander's SA-X Duels. Beams, missiles, and supers all have their own button. Power bombs are deployed with the missile button.
**Players can see the item inside the Core-X**
 - No longer do people need to memorize a table of colors or what color Zazabi was, now the items can optionally be seen on the Core-X itself. Enabled through the Sensitivity Mode setting.
 - TODO: make it its own setting
## Balance changes
**Core-X absorbs no longer freeze you in place**
 - This had the ability to kill you speed boosts and softlock you on elevators, so it was removed.
**All health drops are 20 HP**
 - Farming for health was a laborious process and slowed down the game more than anything else.
**Thoth elevator no longer spawns unless you rid it up**
 - The elevator is very restrictive to your movement and can cause soft-locks when the game gets paused. SA-X were already routinely riding it down then jumping back up the elevator shaft, so it seemed best to remove it entirely.
**EMP doors open as soon as the battery is in place**
 - TODO: write non-dismissive description text
 - TODO: make the door sound play at the right time
**SA-X map starts out gray**
 - The SA-X map always being filled made it ard to tell where you and your teammates had been, and especially affected non-experimental games.
 - TODO: make metroids properly display on the SA-X map
## Map changes
**Main Caves**
 - Added a one-way pipe above the Entrance to Area 3, you can open it with a missile!
![good morning steele](/notes/1.9/Dules/a0h09.gif)
 - Added a screw-locked shortcut from the U-bend room near First Alpha to the A2 EMP Ball room.
  - (possible example image pending)
 - Added a screw-locked shortcut between the cave with the shinespark item and the top right Gamma metroid.
**Industrial Complex**
 - Added a speed-locked shortcut from deep A3 "the one I never want to hear about again" to the BG3 room before the final Gamma metroid.
 - Added a screw-locked pipe between deep A3 "the one I never want to hear about again" and the A1 EMP Ball room.
## Bug fixes
 - Changed the config location to prevent issues with new settings.
 - Add some default values to prevent crashes.
 - Made some screw attack blocks stop appearing when you don't have screw attack to prevent getting trapped.
 - Allow players to pick up items if they stopped being a spectator/Core-X without resetting the room.
 - Fix the one missing screw block in the Bullet Hell room.
 - Scrub newline characters from usernames when they get set.
