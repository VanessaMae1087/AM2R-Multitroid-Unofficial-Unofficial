To contribute to a Repository with YAM2RP you will need 3 things:

1: A Code Editor of some kind. VSCode, notepad, or other things.
2: UndertaleModTool: YAM2RP is a script that imports everything you need to a base copy from the repository folder you select using UTMTLib, which requires UndertaleModTool.
3: YAM2RP and it's related scripts. Best way is to clone the YAM2RP Repository here to stay up to date on changes: https://github.com/DodoBirby/YAM2RP

YAM2RP's instructions are available on it's Github in README.MD

The Base Data.win we use to develop is from the 1.8.1U Profile. Do not save changes to the data.win itself, or you will need to obtain another data.win.
The only legitimate way to obtain a data.win for 1.8.1U is to patch the 1.1 version using the 1.8.1U patch, preferably with the AM2RLauncher.

PLEASE ONLY PUT CHANGED FILES IN THE YAM2RP REPOSITORY
TILESETS MUST BE PLACED IN BACKGROUNDS FOLDER FOUND IN "GRAPHICS"
