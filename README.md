# AM2R-Multitroid-Unofficial-Patch
Unofficial fork of
[DodoBirb's unofficial fork](https://github.com/DodoBirby/AM2R-Multitroid-Unofficial-Patch/) of
[milesthenerd's Multitroid mod](https://github.com/milesthenerd/AM2R-Multitroid).
This is an SA-X mode focused continuation of Multitroid to try and improve the experience and
customization by adding new features.

## Downloading Source/Contributing
This mod is created using [Undertale Mod Tool](https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool)
(UTMT). As of writing, YAM2RP's (see below) scripts do not work with UnderAnalyzer introduced
in 0.8.0.0, so it's recommended to use 0.7.0.0.

This repository is deisgned to use [YAM2RP](https://github.com/DodoBirby/YAM2RP) to patch a
Multitroid 1.8.1 datafile. Download and unzip it either in a folder covered by PATH, or close
to your copy of this repository and a 1.8.1 data.win. Open your favorite terminal and type
something along the lines of `YAM2RP path/to/base-181.data.win path/to/repo/YAM2RP path/to/unouno.build.win`.
This will create a patched data.win that you can open in UTMT and export anything you change.
Code files can be copied out, object and room files can be exported using
[these](https://github.com/DodoBirby/YAM2RP/tree/main/ExportScripts) scripts, and so on. See
YAM2RP's readme for more information.

To obtain a 1.8.1 data.win, download
[this release](https://github.com/VanessaMae1087/AM2R-Multitroid-Unofficial-Unofficial/releases/tag/1.8.1)
and install it like a normal AM2R mod, then open the profile folder and copy out the data.win.
